# node-dota2-bot
This project is a fork from [Crazy-Duck's original bot](https://github.com/Arcana/node-dota2-bot)

Wrapper around the node-dota2 library which handles all log-in shenanigans. 
This basic DotaBot class prepares an object for connection to Steam and the 
Dota2 Game Coordinator. As soon as `connect(callback)` is called, the DotaBot 
connects to Steam and the Dota2 GC. As soon as all connections are made, 
the queue is started. From then on, all scheduled functions will be executed as 
soon as the GC is available.
